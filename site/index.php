    <p>lib<i>avg</i> is a high-level multimedia platform with a focus on interactive installations. It is meant to pick up where Adobe Flash leaves off and gives you high-quality hardware-accelerated visuals as well as easy and flexible authoring, testing and deployment. lib<i>avg</i> works well with other open-source solutions for sound, networking and hardware device support, resulting in a complete and well-integrated package. It uses an xml-based layout language for screen design and python as scripting language.</p>
    <p>lib<i>avg</i> is currently available for Linux and Mac OS X. It is open source and licensed under the LGPL (For details, click on License in the menu).</p>

    <h2 class="news">MTC Construction HowTo <span class="date">October 14, 2007</span></h2>
    <p>People are asking us how to build their own multitouch device, so we wrote up some <a href="https://www.libavg.de/wiki/index.php/Building_a_MultiTouch_Console">instructions</a>.
    <h2 class="news">Version 0.7.0 Available <span class="date">August 31, 2007</span></h2>
    <p>A long time span between libavg releases doesn't mean we haven't been busy. Lots of work went into constructing our MultiTouch Console MTC (<a href="http://www.multitouch.de">http://www.multitouch.de</a>), so that libavg now has complete support for multitouch input devices and generally supports camera tracking. Other than that, libavg's video decoder is now multithreaded, resulting in even better performance - especially on multicore processors. The documentation has improved: there are several new tutorials, and the reference is much more thorough. As always, a lot else has happened as well. For the gory details, see the NEWS file in the distribution.
    <h2 class="news">Version 0.6.0 Available <span class="date">October 25, 2006</span></h2>
    <p>libavg 0.6.0 adds support for dynamically adding nodes to and removing nodes from an active avg tree, thus making the library a lot more flexible. Lots of other minor things have been improved - see the NEWS file in the distribution.
    <h2 class="news">Version 0.5.9 Available <span class="date">August 11, 2006</span></h2>
    <p>The new version includes Intel Mac support, support for videos with alpha channels, much improved automatic tests and thus (hopefully) better stability, Mac vertical blanking support, support for multisampling, gamma correction and lots of minor bugfixes.
    <h2 class="news">Complete Website Overhaul <span class="date">May 10, 2006</span></h2>
    <p>Behold what Macro of <a href="http://www.macrone.de">http://www.macrone.de</a> has done: A complete redesign of the website. There's lots of new content as well.
    <h2 class="news">First Mac OS X Version Released
    <span class="date">May 8, 2006</span></h2>
    <p>A Mac installer is now available on the downloads page. It contains a pkg that installs libavg on your harddisk with a doubleclick. No further configuration should initially be necessary - just add import avg to your python scripts. The Mac version uses the ttf fonts installed in the standard mac font directories and uses Mac OpenGL extensions for video acceleration. At the moment, it has beta status, so don't expect everything to work yet. It's been tested on PowerPCs running Tiger. Intel Macs aren't supported yet.</p>
