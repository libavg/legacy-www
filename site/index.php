    <p>lib<i>avg</i> is a high-level multimedia platform with a focus on interactive installations. It is meant to pick up where Macromedia Director leaves off and gives you high-quality hardware-accelerated visuals as well as easy and flexible authoring, testing and deployment. lib<i>avg</i> integrates well with other open-source solutions for sound, networking and hardware device support, resulting in a complete and well-integrated package. It uses an xml-based layout language for screen design and python as scripting language.</p>
	<p>lib<i>avg</i> is currently available for Linux and Mac OS X. It is open source and licensed under the LGPL (For details, click on License in the menu).</p>

    <p>Behold what Macro of <a href="http://www.macrone.de">http://www.macrone.de</a> has done: A complete redesign of the website. There's lots of new content as well.
    <h2 class="news">First Mac OS X Version Released
    <span class="date">May 8, 2006</span></h2>
	<p>A Mac installer is now available on the downloads page. It contains a pkg that installs libavg on your harddisk with a doubleclick. No further configuration should initially be necessary - just add import avg to your python scripts. The Mac version uses the ttf fonts installed in the standard mac font directories and uses Mac OpenGL extensions for video acceleration. At the moment, it has beta status, so don't expect everything to work yet. It's been tested on PowerPCs running Tiger. Intel Macs aren't supported yet.</p>
